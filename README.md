# Youtube Clone Application

Introducing our web application that replicates the functionality of YouTube, enabling users to seamlessly search and play videos. The application is meticulously crafted with React and Javascript, employing powerful state management through Redux.

To enhance user experience, we have integrated the official Vimeo API, ensuring a robust video library for users to explore and enjoy. Authentication is seamlessly implemented, utilizing JWT access tokens to secure user interactions and provide a personalized experience.
